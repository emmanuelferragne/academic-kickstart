I've been a **Maître de Conférences** (Associate Professor) in English phonetics at Université de Paris since 2009. January-June 2020: full-time CNRS researcher at [Laboratoire de Phonétique et Phonologie] (http://lpp.in2p3.fr/).

I initially studied **translation**, then moved to **English studies** where I developed a keen interest for **linguistics and phonetics**. I've always enjoyed the most technical aspects of my job: working with instruments (ultrasound imaging, EEG, EGG, etc.), programming and data analysis (Praat, R, Matlab, C#, Python, etc.). I've been doing this for almost 20 years so, although I've had no formal training, you could probably call me a **data scientist**.

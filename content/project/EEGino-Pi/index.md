My colleague [Maud PÃ©lissier](https://univ-paris3.academia.edu/MaudP%C3%A9lissier) and I are currently setting-up a simplified, 1-channel wearable EEG system for our linguistic experiments. We want to use it in more realistic contexts outside the lab and for demos in class.

## How does it compare to professional gear?

| Feature | EEGino Pi   |    professional |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|sample rate (Hz) | 1,000 | 1,000 |
|resolution (bits) |  10 | 24 |
|number of channels | up to 4 | > 32
|pricing &euro;| approx. 300 | approx. 30,000 |

With 1 electrode in the occipital region, eyes closed, we get very decent alpha waves (band-pass filtered):

Although it is not directly comparable partly because of our imperfect ad-hoc post-sync method, here is the signal recorded at the same location with our pro-grade system with an estimatd lag of -300 to 300 ms re the EEGino Pi signal.

Time-frequency representation for the EEGino Pi:

Corresponding time-frequency plot for the pro EEG:

**From this rather informal visual test, it seems that our prototype could be a good substitute for a professional EEG system in cases where spatial resolution and bit depth are not critical.**

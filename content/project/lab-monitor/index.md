This is an IoT project whose aim is to monitor how students use our lab so that we can try and adapt the lab to students' needs. I described the project in an [interview] (https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/monitoring-lab-raspberry-pi/) to the MagPi magazine. The public Thingspeak IoT channel is available [here] (https://thingspeak.com/channels/430548).
